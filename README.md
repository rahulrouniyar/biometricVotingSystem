# biometricVotingSystem
This project is done as a part of Minor project. 


We built biometric voting system that could perform tasks such as voter registration, voter details modification,
candidate registration and modification, party registration and modification, 
and voting platform based on biometric authentication(fingerprint).


We used Pyqt5 to design the UI part and then wrote their respective backend part to perform their respective functions.

Demo of the application:
